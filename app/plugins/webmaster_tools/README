  Getting Help

  You can post questions regarding the usage of the plugin to the very active
  Official CakePHP Mailinglist (http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php). When
  question are anwsered there (I try to answer them all) it helps everybody
  reading the list. This is also the reason why I prefer not to answer direct
  support requests through email or other messaging systems.

  Bugs
  ----
  If you've found a bug or would like to suggest a feature create a ticket in the
  issue tracker. You'll find the tracker at:

  Contributing
  ------------
  If you have some ideas for improving this library just fork the repository,
  make your changes and when ready send a pull request to notify me about the
  changes you made. I'll review them and see if I can merge them back. Please
  style your code according to the code which is already there.

  Please note that code which is supposed to be merged into this (blessed)
  repository must carry the same header (including the copyright statement) as
  all code in the library and should be free of any @author tags. This may seem
  a little strange at first. But let me explain: Multiple copyright
  holders/licenses complicate things where not necessary. @author tags seem to
  mark sections of code as belonging to, owned or claimed by the specific author.

  As an alternative the project has a dedicated AUTHORS file where every contributor
  is listed with her/his name/nick along with an email address.
